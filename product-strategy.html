        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Relationship between Platform OKRs and Product Group OKRs</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">The platform OKRs and product group OKRs are designed to work together in a hierarchical structure to achieve the overall goal of "Production in a Day" while leveraging AI to accelerate development, enhance developer happiness, and avoid costs. Here's how they relate:</p>
        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside mb-4">
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Alignment:</strong> Each product group's objectives and key results are directly aligned with one or more platform-level strategic themes, with a strong emphasis on AI-Accelerated Development, Developer Experience, and Automation & Efficiency.</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Cascading Effect:</strong> The platform OKRs set the overall direction and high-level targets for AI integration, developer satisfaction, and cost reduction. Product group OKRs then break these down into more specific, actionable objectives and measurable results that contribute to the platform-level goals.</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Contribution to North Star:</strong> While product groups focus on their specific areas of AI implementation, their collective achievements drive progress towards the North Star metric of "Production in a Day" by enhancing efficiency, improving developer experience, and reducing costs.</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Complementary Focus:</strong> Different product groups approach the AI-Accelerated Development theme from various angles, each applying AI to their specific domain to boost overall platform capabilities while contributing to developer happiness and cost avoidance.</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Balanced Approach:</strong> By having multiple product groups aligned with each platform theme, we ensure a comprehensive approach to achieving our goals, addressing various aspects of the development lifecycle with AI enhancements that improve both developer experience and operational efficiency.</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Measurability:</strong> Platform-level key results represent aggregate improvements in AI adoption, developer happiness, and cost avoidance, while product group key results are more specific to AI implementations in their respective areas, all contributing to these overarching metrics.</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Flexibility:</strong> This structure allows for adjustments in AI implementation strategies at the product group level without necessarily changing the platform-level strategy, providing both stability and adaptability in our AI acceleration efforts while maintaining focus on developer satisfaction and cost efficiency.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="mb-4">By maintaining this relationship between platform and product group OKRs, we ensure that all teams are working cohesively towards our common goals of AI-accelerated development, enhanced developer happiness, and cost avoidance, while allowing for specialized AI implementations within each area of the developer platform.</p>
